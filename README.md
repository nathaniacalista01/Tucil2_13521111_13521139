## **General Description**

Finding nearest pair of points is a problem where there are
k-points inside a n-dimension room and we are asked to find
which pair has the closest distance. There can be multiple approcahes or algorthims that can be used to solve this problem. However, this program use **divide and conquer algorithm**.

## **Program's Requirement** 
Since this program is build with Python programming language and use matplotlib to visualize the points, users need to install: <br><br>
**1. Python3** <br>
```sh
   $ sudo apt-get install python3
```
Another alternative to install python is by download it directly from https://www.python.org/downloads/ <br><br>

**2. matplotlib library** <br>
```sh
    $ pip install matplotlib
```


## **How to Run Program** 
1. Clone this repository <br>
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nathaniacalista01/Tucil2_13521111_13521139.git
```

2. Change the directory to the location where the main program is stored <br>

```sh
$ cd Tucil2_1352111_13521139/src
```

3. Run the main program 

```sh
$ main.py
```
