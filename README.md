## **General Description**

Finding nearest pair of points is a problem where there are
k-points inside a n-dimension room and we are asked to find
which pair has the closest distance. There can be multiple approcahes or algorthims that can be used to solve this problem. However, this program use **divide and conquer algorithm**.

## **Program's Requirement**
